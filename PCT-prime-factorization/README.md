# Prime factorization

Semester project for KIV/PCT.

The task is to write an Assembly code for the Renesas H8S/2600 family
of processors, that takes a 16-bit number from the Simulated I/O and prints
back its prime factorization.

The code itself is in `main.s`, the rest of the files are boilerplate for the HEW
and the H8S emulator.
